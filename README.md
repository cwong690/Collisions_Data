# Analysis of Traffic Collision Data

These materials relate to the workshop for analyzing Seattle area traffic collision data.  

We are excited to launch a data science project analyzing Seattle traffic collision data to help prioritize road improvements and prevent future collisions. This is an opportunity to work through a project with real world data from beginning to end in a small team with experienced data scientists.  

To prepare for this project we are hosting a virtual workshop focused on time series analysis and forecasting with python at 6 p.m. on July 1st. Data science knowledge is not required, but prior experience with Jupyter notebooks and Python is important.

#### Sponsor

This project and workshop are sponsored by the [Data Circles](datacircles.org) organization.  

Data Circles (formerly SeaWiDS) exists to provide a place for women in data science to connect, build community, support each other and grow. In less than two years Data Circles, has grown into a community with more than 1,800 members.  

Teams of volunteers organize monthly events in the Greater Seattle area, including: technical talks, informational panels, career development workshops, hackathons, conferences, networking events, book clubs, mentoring, study sessions, and interview prep.
